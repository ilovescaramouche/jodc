    <input type="radio" id="ict1" name="ict">
    <label for="ict1">Lesson 1: Introduction to CSS</label>
    <div class="lesson-content">
      <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and format HTML documents. It allows web developers to control the appearance of web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. CSS separates content from design, making websites easier to maintain and more visually appealing. This lesson introduces the purpose of CSS, its syntax, and its role in the presentation layer of a webpage.</p>

    <input type="radio" id="ict2" name="ict">
    <label for="ict2">Lesson 2: Structure of CSS</label>
    <div class="lesson-content">
      <p>CSS is composed of selectors and declarations. A selector targets HTML elements, while declarations define the styles to apply. Each declaration includes a property and a value, enclosed in curly braces. This lesson explains how to write CSS rules, the importance of declaration blocks, and how browsers interpret these rules to render styled content. It also covers the concept of style sheets and how they affect webpage layout.</p>
    </div>

    <input type="radio" id="ict3" name="ict">
    <label for="ict3">Lesson 3: Types of Style Sheets</label>
    <div class="lesson-content">
      <p>There are three main types of CSS: inline, internal (embedded), and external. Inline styles are written directly within HTML tags, internal styles are placed in the `<head>` section of an HTML document, and external styles are stored in separate `.css` files. This lesson compares their advantages and disadvantages, explains how to link external stylesheets, and demonstrates how each type affects webpage design and maintainability.</p>
    </div>

    <input type="radio" id="ict4" name="ict">
    <label for="ict4">Lesson 4: CSS Rules and Classes</label>
    <div class="lesson-content">
      <p>CSS rules consist of selectors and declarations. Classes are reusable selectors defined with a dot (`.`) and applied to HTML elements using the `class` attribute. This lesson explores how to create and apply classes, the difference between class and element selectors, and how to combine multiple classes. It also introduces the concept of specificity and how CSS rules are prioritized when multiple styles apply.</p>
    </div>

    <input type="radio" id="ict5" name="ict">
    <label for="ict5">Lesson 5: CSS Selectors</label>
    <div class="lesson-content">
      <p>Selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling. This lesson covers various types of selectors: element/tag selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, universal selectors (`*`), group selectors (e.g., `h1, p`), and attribute selectors (e.g., `input[type="text"]`). Each selector type is explained with examples, and students learn when and why to use each based on the structure and needs of their webpage.</p>
    </div>

    <input type="radio" id="ict6" name="ict">
    <label for="ict6">Lesson 6: Dimensions and Visibility</label>
    <div class="lesson-content">
      <p>This lesson focuses on controlling the size and visibility of HTML elements using CSS properties. Students learn about `width`, `height`, `max-width`, `min-height`, `line-height`, and `visibility`. Examples show how these properties affect layout and user experience. The lesson also introduces the `display` property and its values (`block`, `inline`, `none`, etc.), and how visibility differs from display in terms of rendering and space allocation.</p>
