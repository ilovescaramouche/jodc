        <h1>Welcome to My Eportfolio</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is John Jorelle Dela Cruz, and I was born on October 10, 2011. I’m someone who enjoys staying active and having fun in different ways. I love playing badminton and running, which help me stay healthy and energetic. During my free time, I also like to watch TV, play video games, and read manga, which let me relax and explore exciting stories and worlds.
