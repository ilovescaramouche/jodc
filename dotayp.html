<h1 align="center">My Dream</h1>
<p>My dream was to become a soldier.<br>
I want to be of service to my countrymen.</p>
<p align="center">I am the eldest, so I need to have
a job immediately after graduation.<br>
I cannot afford to be idle for a long period of time.</p>
<p>So I decided not to pursue my dream and become an Engineer.</p>
<p align="justify">I did not regret my decision... I did it because...<br>
I love my family... and they always come first.</p>
